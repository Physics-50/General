## Overview

Estimating the uncertainty of our measurements enables us to make conclusions from our data. For example, imagine you measured the speed of two passing cars (car "A" and car "B") in three different ways:

In panel (i), the measured velocities of cars A and B are reported, but we are given no indication of how certain we are about the results from those two measurements. It's difficult to draw a conclusion from this type of data because we don't know how confident we are about the two data points. 

Instead, if the values are reported with their uncertainties as in (ii), the error bars (the vertical lines around each data point) give an indication of how confident we are that the actual speed for each car falls within a range of values. In this example, the velocity of car A is reported as $$v_A = 23 \pm 5\,\mathrm{m/s}$$ and the velocity of car B is $$v_B = 18 \pm 5 \, \mathrm{m/s}$$. Because the error bars are relatively large compared to the difference between A and B in (ii), we might conclude the following: *"The speed of A and B was measured to be similar and their difference was within the experimental uncertainty of $$\pm$$ 5 m/s."* In other words, the experiment was not sensitive enough to tell the difference between the speed of A and B. 

If we had used a more sensitive experimental technique, that would give a smaller uncertainty as in (iii). This smaller experimental uncertainty lets us make a more powerful conclusion: *"The velocity of car A was measured to be faster than that of car B, with $$v_A = 23 \pm 2\,\mathrm{m/s}$$ and $$v_B = 18 \pm 2 \, \mathrm{m/s}$$.* By minimizing sources of uncertainty in our experiments and providing accurate estimates of how large the uncertainties are in our measurements, we are able to make strong conclusions about our experiments.

That's our goal as experimental scientists: to make strong conclusions based on our data. To do this we need to try to minimize the uncertainty when we perform a measurement. We must be aware of how much variance there is in the data and how to quantify that variance. We want to be aware of what factors in the experiment are introducing the most significant uncertainty and determine if there is some way we can improve the experimental design within our laboratory constraints. During an experiment you will need to ask yourself what factors could influence the result of your measurement. Each of these factors can be thought of as working against our having perfect knowledge about a “measurand” (the quantity we want to measure) and adding to the overall uncertainty in the result. A crucial aspect of experimentation is to identify the most important sources of uncertainty and to numerically estimate their effect on your measurement result.

Common sources of uncertainty include:

+ your judgment in reading analog instruments;
+ the sensitivity of your instruments (e.g., the digital scale, smallest interval on a meter stick, etc.);
+ the rating or stated calibration of the instrument;
+ approximations and assumptions that you make while doing the experiment;
+ variations in repeated readings made under apparently identical conditions; and
+ the effects of environmental conditions on the measurement.

A measurement uncertainty is not meant to be an indication of “mistakes” that you might make in an experiment. If you are aware that you have made a mistake, then you should repeat your experiment or at least exclude the data taken improperly. Similarly, “human error” is not a useful way of identifying a source of uncertainty; that phrase provides future experimenters with no guidance at all about what aspects of the experimental apparatus or procedures to focus on improving.

## Sources of Uncertainty
There are many sources of uncertainty in your experiment, but not all originate in the same manner and therefore there are different methods of accounting for them.  When designing an experiment the aim is to make the uncertainty small enough to achieve the experiment’s goal — or often, to make the uncertainty as small as possible in order to observe as much detail as possible about the phenomenon.  However, always keep in mind that the uncertainty can never be reduced to zero, just made small and honestly estimated.
