Before you begin working on this module you will need to collect a kit with supplies for module 1. These kits will be available from the Jacobs-Keck courtyard on Tuesday, January 18 from 9:30am-5:00pm. [If you are unable to collect a kit on this date please follow this link](getting-kits).

For all experiments in this course, you will keep a data sheet (Google Sheet) and a lab notebook (Google Doc) that are individually assigned to you through Google Classroom.  Before you can access your assigned documents, you must first go to Google Classroom through a Chrome browser logged into your g.hmc.edu account and join the class with classroom code: **tn6uwnu** - or use this [link](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/NDQ2NjQ4MzA5Njky/t/all). After you've done this once, you will not have to log into Google classroom separately again; all links to documents we provide through Google classroom in this lab manual should work.  Once you've signed up for Google classroom you will also receive links to your assigned spreadsheet and lab notebook via e-mail, or you can access them through Google classroom under classwork - Module 0.

Please make sure to join Google classroom from your g.hmc.edu account. Students from other Claremont colleges taking the course should consult HMC's CIS support if you have any issues - they will issue you a g.hmc.edu account. **The course will not appear in your Google Classroom account until you join the course with the class code.**

We begin our investigation to measure the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, by doing an initial exploration. Our goal is to come up with a hypothesis to test and a plan for how we will do so (an experimental design). In the Exploratory Phase it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook and data spreadsheet can be tricky, so for Week 1 we are providing a [template Google Sheet and Google Doc you should use, assigned from Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/MzY5MzA2OTcxNzM4/t/all){:target="_blank"}. 

**Make sure you have your data spreadsheet and your Module 1 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this page. Please note that we require you to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook. The shared spreadsheet will make it easier for us to troubleshoot if any issues come up and provides a historical record of your data collection. The spreadsheet/lab notebook assigned through Google classroom are the only documents you will have access to for the practicum at the end of the course. It is acceptable for lab partners to use one spreadsheet for collecting data. However, if you do so the partner whose spreadsheet was not used for data collection must 1) make a note in their spreadsheet stating that the data was originally collected in your lab partner's notebook and 2) ensure you have a copy of the complete data set pasted into your own Google classroom assigned spreadsheet (once in person labs resume, make sure to do this before leaving lab). Discussion and collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but both partners are individually responsible for completing their own analysis for the checkpoints and deliverables and submitting their own work.**


## Preface
If you have any questions outside of class, we encourage you to reach out to your classmates through the class Piazza site or come to office hours to talk to an instructor. [You can sign up for the class Piazza site here.](https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2022/ph50)

Before diving into data collection and analysis we would like to set some expectations. This course centers around the collection, analysis, and communication of experimental data and results. We expect all of these to be conducted with care and integrity.

Collaboration:
We expect every student to perform the data analysis, miniquestions, checkpoints, and deliverables for themselves, but you are welcome to discuss your results and analysis with your lab partner and classmates. For module 1 you may work on your own or with any other student in the course, but you may not work in a group of more than 2 students.

To make sure we all start on the same page please answer the following mini-questions (mini-questions will appear throughout this manual and are required to be completed before you arrive in lab each week. Please see the syllabus for more information regarding mini-questions) - mini-questions are interspersed throughout the lab manual and need to be completed before the start of lab.

Data Collection:
Please make sure you read the tips for electronic lab notebooks in the syllabus. We emphasize that your notebook is a record of the experiment. Deleting experimental data from a lab notebook is never acceptable. However, it is acceptable to remeasure/reanalyze data because of inaccurate or incorrect initial efforts. This includes retaking data with an improved experimental procedure. 

An example of an acceptable note keeping and data collection would be: 

You are trying to time how fast your little brother can run. Initially you do this in your hallway but you realize you are getting unreliable results. You take him to a track and restart the experiment in a way that is less sensitive to the initial conditions. You make a note next to the data you collected with a procedure you believe to be less reliable and then focus on the newly collected data in your analysis, but you do not delete the original data from your lab notebook.

## Background Reading

Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. We are measuring the coefficient of static friction, a dimensionless number that depends on the two surfaces in contact. This video from Prof. Arlett on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide some background and a quick refresher:
[<img src="images/static-friction-video-preview.png" alt="refresher on how mu_s is related to theta_c" width="400"/>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJCo0SK2Mi3Z8hzRhgZ8WHyLzuaXgzMx/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} 

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result.

## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

#### Mini-question: Critical Angle Factors
[*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://forms.gle/oUrvxpsg5foNjnVH7){:target="_blank"}

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFH6ZBvZzAlN_LNJQqnmFCPN97KyLGW44mU-AsTd_XSAxcTw/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="300" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…

-----

Based on this answer, can you think of any hypotheses you could try to test? 

**While there are many different hypotheses you might consider, for Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis. The hypothesis we will test is:**

*"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle at which an object slips is independent of the mass of the sliding object."*

## Instrumentation

Now that we've decided what hypothesis we are going to test, we need to figure out what equipment and experimental tools we are going to use. For this module, a ramp, container, and different masses (bags of bolts) that can be placed in the container were provided to you in the kit you should have collected for module 1. Each of the bags of bolts and the container have been labelled with their mass. Please do not open the bags of bolts!

To measure the angle you will use your phone and the **Phyphox** App. Please go to [phyphox.org](https://phyphox.org){:target="_blank"} (or to the app store on your device) and download the phyphox app. Try to do this before you come to class for the first day of lab. After downloading, find the "Inclination" tool and test that it works correctly with your phone.

<img src="images/phyphox.png" alt="phyphox.org inclination tool" width="400"/>

Make note of your equipment in your lab notebook (record keeping is important) and record any other notes you think might be helpful if someone else were trying to replicate your setup. Remember: for the praciticum you will only have access to your Google-classroom-assigned lab notebook and data sheet.

## Exploratory Measurements

The exploratory measurements can be a fun part of the experimental process. You get to play around with your setup and make some observations! You can really let your curiosity and creativity guide you in this part of the experimental process. 

For your exploratory measurements in Module 1, we would like you to do the following:

+ Perform and analyze a single measurement (yes, one trial) to check that you are getting a reasonable answer

+ Get an understanding of the repeatability of your measurement 

+ Check other factors that might affect your measurement and its reproducibility (this is where you get to play!)

The steps below guide you through these three items, and provide links to important concepts (so please follow along carefully). Make sure you are recording your exploratory observations as you go so that you have a record of them (reminder: we have set up [a spreadsheet for you on Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/NDQ2NjQ4MzA5Njky/tc/NDQ2NjQ4MzA5NzEx){:target="_blank"}; use the "Week 1: Exploratory Observations" tab to record your data in this section. Please make use of the organization of the template already set up for you to record your data.)

#### Perform a Single Measurement

Usually one of the first exploratory steps is to use your equipment to take a single measurement. We want to make sure that our measurement (in this case, $$\theta_c$$) will lead to a reasonable value of the calculated quantity we are trying to obtain ($$\mu_s$$). We also want to get a sense of what potential difficulties arise as we follow our planned experimental procedure for the first time.

+ You can choose how much mass to place in the block for this first measurement, but to get a representative initial value it is helpful to avoid extremes, i.e. add some mass to the container but don't overload it. 

+ Place the container with the mass you have chosen to start with on the ramp 

+ Use the tape provided in your kit to secure your phone to the ramp

+ Slowly raise the ramp while keeping an eye on the plane inclination measurement on the phyphox app. Record in the spreadsheet the value of the angle you observe just before slipping (in other words, perform a single measurement of $$\theta_c$$).

+ Calculate $$\mu_s$$ from your single measurement of $$\theta_c$$ (using the relationship derived in the [background reading](#background-reading)). 

*Friendly reminder: convert the angle from degrees to radians in your Google Sheet calculation. 

Comment on whether your measured value is reasonable (e.g. is $$\mu_s$$ within the limits of allowable values, i.e. between 0 and infinity?  With a quick google search, is it similar to $$\mu_s$$ for similar surfaces?  At this point, if your answer were to be unreasonable or you were unable to calculate the quantity you are interested in testing (in our case $$\mu_s$$), then it would be a good idea to carefully rethink your measurement. Doing this initial single measurement and check can save a lot of time, especially when the experimental setup gets more complicated as it will later in the course. 

## Introduction to Experimental Uncertainty

The "Uncertainty Introduction" has information we are going to need in Ph50 about treating sources of experimental uncertainty. For this week please read the [overview on uncertainties](uncertainty-introduction-overview-only){:target="_blank"}.  This is an excerpt from a more extended guide that we will return to in later sections. 

## Reproducibility

Read [this discussion about random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty) 

The goal of testing repeatability is to get a sense of the random error associated with variations in the measurement from trial to trial. 

Take a few (maybe five) measurements of $$\theta_c$$ under identical conditions. Make sure you "reset" your experimental setup each time: start the ramp from a horizontal position ($$\theta = 0$$), place the block onto the ramp, and then slowly start to raise the ramp.  Resetting helps ensure that if individual measurements are less than ideal in some way, at least they are not all biased in the same way as each other.

Trial #	| $$\theta_c$$ (degrees)	
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|

Using the information provided in the [discussion on random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty), calculate the standard error of the mean [SEM] for your data.
    
Reducing random uncertainty can include both improving our measurement technique to reduce the spread in our data and  taking many repeated trials. It is often helpful to do both. This is also your chance to take some initiative. The approach you use to measure the angle at which the container begins to slip will significantly affect the reproducibility. You should give some consideration to how to reliably determine the critical angle - trying to press a button on your phone as the container is starting to move while holding the ramp is unlikely to yield reproducible results. Take the time to explore techniques that might help you to get more reproducible results. Your kit includes a piece of string and a binder clip that you can use to attach it to the ramp which you may or may not find helpful. If you aren't sure where to start talk to your instructor. You may find it helpful to know that Phyphox can record data for later extraction. If you click on an angle vs. time graph and then use **Pick data**, you can select and read off the value of data points after the fact. This is helpful if, for example, you are quickly lowering the ramp when the container begins to slip and then going back to find the maximum angle; if you know the critical angle was the highest angle reached, you don't need to press any buttons on the phone during the experiment. Alternatively you might consider using a second phone to record the experiment including your Phyphox screen, so you can go back and more accurately determine the moment at which the container began to slip. Designing/setting up the experiment in a way that will allow you to get reproducible results is a critical part of the experimental process and of this course. Don't assume that more complicated must be better; let the reproducibility of data, and your own observations of failure modes, be your guides.


## Propagating Uncertainties
+ Learn how to propagate uncertainties from this video of Prof. Gerbode explaining how to propagate uncertainty in $$\theta_c$$ to uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ and answer the mini-question below

You can get some additional practice propagating uncertainty [here](uncertainty-introduction#extra-practice)

## Propagation of Your Experimental Uncertainty

After watching the video from Prof. Gerbode, let's return to your measurement of $$\mu_s$$ from $$\theta_c$$:

First, complete this mini-question to ensure you are doing the calculation correctly:

#### Mini-question: Calculating coefficient of static friction and uncertainty
[*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://forms.gle/mvteqnKeZNQXDytZ9){:target="_blank"}

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKSGfERWII08uU0DZio3Wtcul85SiBFLkbG44IAQgMJg4hMg/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="300" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…

-------------

+  Calculate the uncertainty in your measurement of the coefficient of static friction ($$\delta \mu_s$$) by propagating your uncertainty $$\delta{\theta_c}$$, the SEM of your measured values. Derive any formulas you use in your lab notebook. Your calculation of $$\delta {\mu_s}$$ should appear in your Google Sheets notebook (please follow the organization of our template and enter formulas in the indicated regions). Remember that we expect your calculations to be done within Google sheets, i.e. in order to receive full credit for your work you should use formulas in Google Sheets to do the math and not a calculator.

 Is your fractional uncertainty reasonable,  (fractional uncertainty $$\equiv \frac{\delta{\mu_s}}{\mu_s} \ll 1$$)? In other words, confirm that the uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ less than the value of $$\mu_s$$ itself?

One of the goals of this course is that you take the time to think about careful experimental procedure. You will be graded on your quality of data as part of your deliverable at the end of each module. If you feel there may be issues with your results but are unsure how to improve your procedure, speak to your instructor.


## Significant Figures when Reporting Results

When doing your analysis, to avoid an accumulation of rounding errors it is very important not to round your results until you reach a final result. However when you do reach a final result, it is important and helpful to round your result appropriately, taking into consideration your uncertainty. Since the uncertainty is a measure of your confidence in your result it makes sense to use it to gauge which digits are *significant*.

Please read through this [guide](Significant-figures) for reporting final results with appropriate significant figures. You should refer back to these guidelines and follow them throughout this course. For future reference you will find a link to this and other guides on the "helpful guidance" tab on Sakai.

Significant figure guidelines apply to final reported results. In this class this will be specifically when you type in a final result in Gradescope or in a figure caption. Please do not round your results at any time within your spreadsheets (although it is okay to adjust the settings in your spreadsheet to display fewer digits if you wish to do so; talk to your instructor if you would like to do this and are unsure how to do so.) 

## What you need to leave lab with:

+ You should have a procedure for collecting data in which you have made an effort to improve the reproducibility of your measurements. This is an important first step to being able to test our hypothesis next week.

+ You should have a set of 5 data points -  all collected with the same mass in the container, using the procedure you settled on to improve reproducibility. This is the data you will use when completing the checkpoint.
 
## Checkpoint 1

Weekly checkpoints are submitted on Gradescope. This week's checkpoint is submitted in two parts. 

**Part 1: Practice calculation**

*You may resubmit Module 1, checkpoint 1, Part 1 as many times as you like until you get the correct answer (it is auto-graded and will give you an immediate response). For this part **only** it is also okay to "save" your responses to the individual questions.*

 You should do part 1 before part 2. **You may find it helpful to attempt part 1 before your time in lab.**

Part 1 is a sample calculation to ensure you are calculating $$\mu_s$$ and propagating the uncertainty correctly. The sample calculation will provide real time feedback. This is to ensure you know how to do the calculation before analyzing your data. For this part (only) it is not an honor code violation to make changes after receiving the feedback and then resubmit.

**Part 2: Post-lab analysis**

**We want to provide timely feedback, yet different lab sections have work due on different days. This means we will frequently return work before all students have submitted their assignments. To make this possible with the constraint of using a shared Gradescope portal for all sections, we cannot accept resubmissions in this course (except when specifically indicated such as part 1 above). Please prepare your assignment in a separate document. When you are ready to submit your work, enter all entries into Gradescope in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting). Your instructor will go over this policy on the first day of class. If you have questions please ask.**


+ You will be asked to submit your measured critical angle, coefficient of friction, and propagated uncertainty. This data should come from data you collected after settling on a procedure to yield reproducible data and should include averaging 5 data points. All 5 data points should have been collected with the same mass in the container.

+ You will also be asked to describe the procedure you have settled on to accurately determine the critical angle.

And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-1){:target="_blank"}

## Checkpoint Deadline

Deadlines for weekly checkpoints and deliverables will be as follows:

+ Wednesday sections: due Sundays at 10 pm
+ Thursday sections: due Mondays at 10 pm
+ Friday sections: due Tuesdays at 10 pm

Please note that since all sections use the same Gradescope portal the deadlines listed on Gradescope are not accurate for all sections and cannot be relied upon.

**When grading the checkpoint we will look for the following:**
+ Were all calculations completed correctly?
+ Does your data look reasonable for the experiment?
+ Did you round too early? (Remember to only round your data when sharing the final result, not during intermediate calculations.)
+ Did you make appropriate use of significant figures when reporting your final result?
+ Did you provide a link to your own spreadsheet, assigned through Google classroom?
+ Is your spreadsheet organized with appropriate annotations if any issues arose during data collection?
+ Does your procedure adequately lay out a method to generate reproducible measurements of the critical angle? 
+ Deductions for failing to submit the checkpoint on time will be applied as outlined in the syllabus
