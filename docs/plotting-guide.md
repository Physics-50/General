## Plotting your data

In Physics 50 you will make use of a script provided on the HMC physics departement website to plot your data:

[Go here to plot physics 50 data](https://physics.hmc.edu/fitter/)

**Please note that use of the provided plotting script for plotting your data is required, plots in Google sheets do not meet course expectations.**

To plot your data you first need to generate a .CSV file containing only your data. You can do this from within your Google Sheets spreadsheet. 

Go to the tab in your spreadsheet that you will use to prepare your data for plotting. For module 3, week 3 this will be the third tab in your Module 1 data sheet: "Week 3: Data for Plotting".

1. You should re-name the column headings in row one to match your data. These will form the axes labels for your plot. You may surround algebraic variables and Greek letters with dollar signs; e.g., $\theta$ (Â°) or $L$ (cm) or $T^2$ (s$^2$) or $L_{\rm string}$ (cm), where \rm allows you to use roman text within a mathetmatical formula.

2. If you followed the template for the "Week 2: Data Collection" tab of the spreadsheet then your entries will already be prefilled into the spreadsheet. Note that the formatting that allows an entry to be copied from a previous sheet. Specifically: ='Week 2: Data Collection'!$B$23 will copy the entry from cell B23 into the new cell. Check to make sure that the entries are indeed the values you wish to export.

3. You should now go to the "File" menu and select "Dowload". From within the download tab select "Comma Separated Values (.csv)".

4. Now go to the [Physics 50 Fitting Page](https://physics.hmc.edu/fitter/). Under data choose the .csv file you just saved. Under kind select the type of fit you would like to perform. In module 1 this will be a "constant" fit, i.e. a horizontal line. Click "Run the Fit".

5. You can save the resulting plot by right clicking on the graph.
