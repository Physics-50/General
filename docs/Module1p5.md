# Module 1.5

Module 1.5 is a one-week introduction to careful experimentation and dealing with uncertainties arising from systematic error.  It is not a full module and has only a short post-lab checkpoint to be turned in. 

**You have been issued a new Google Sheet and Google Doc through Google Classroom for Module 1.5. Make sure you have both the Google Sheet and the Google Doc (your Module 1.5 lab notebook) handy as you go through the content on this Week 1 page. Remember: you are required to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook.**

The experiment: You will roll a ball down a ramp and let it fall from the end of the ramp to the floor. The ramp should be set to 5° from the horizontal. You need to measure the horizontal distance between the end of the ramp and the ball's first landing point on the floor, including an estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.

The pressure-sensitive tape provided on your bench can be used to visualize where the ball lands. 

Please follow these instructions:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: measure, with uncertainty, the horizontal distance traveled by a ball falling to the floor after rolling down an inclined plane placed on top of a lab bench.

Steps:
+ Set the incline of the “ramp” to 5° above the table. 
+ Move the lower end of the ramp to the edge of the table.
+ Use the blue masking tape to attach a length of pressure sensitive tape (roll of colored paper) to the floor where you anticipate the ball will land.
+ Place the ball 1 meter from the lower end of the ramp (measured along the length of the ramp) and release.
+ Repeat as often as necessary to obtain a value for the horizontal distance “d” traveled by the ball (measured from the end of the ramp) and your best estimate of the associated uncertainty in “d.”


You should spend ~30 min trying to get a good estimate of the ditance "d" and its uncertainty. Please submit your estimate and uncertainty on the following form: (only one lab partner should submit your team's result)

Once you have submitted your result please think about how you might obtain a more accurate estimate. You should not move on to the final estimate below until the class has discussed the initial estimate results and procedures for final estimates.

One of our goals in these first few weeks is to become comfortable with what it means to report a value with uncertainty. We've prepared a guide to help you through our expectations. Here is an excerpt that we encourage you to look through:

Following the class discussion and further investigations guided by it, please submit your final estimate here:

Before preparing your checkpoint please read through this guideline for reporting results with appropriate significant figures. You should refer back to these guidelines and follow them throughout this course.

## Reporting Data with Significant Figures

Something to consider when communicating your results is the number of significant figures (decimal places) you report. Imagine you calculated the mean value for the distance from the table and its uncertainty. The value you obtain from Google Sheets is 14.14030407 ± 0.40372678, and remember that we reported the number of centimeters (cm). So you should communicate this value when you write up your experimental results, right? Hold on:  do you really know the value of d to the 8th decimal place? Our uncertainty of $$\delta d = $$0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 cm tells us that we are unsure of the 1st decimal place, so we are definitely not sure about the value in the 8th decimal place of $$d = $$14.1403040<span style="color:red">7</span> cm! This digit is insignificant; you don’t truly have that kind of precision in this experiment and cannot quote results that would imply otherwise.

This is where the term significant figures, or “sig figs” for short, comes into play. We only want to report digits that are significant — accurately reflect the precision of our experiment — in our results. 

Here are the two steps to follow to determine significant digits:

1. Round and keep only one digit in your uncertainty.

    + in our example this would mean we report our uncertainty as $$\delta d = 0.4$$ cm

    **Exception**: if the most significant digit (i.e., the first nonzero digit) — in our example above, the digit in red 0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 — is a 1 or 2, then report two digits in the uncertainty. For example: if your uncertainty is 0.0237304 then its most significant digit is a 2 so we will keep two digits, resulting in an uncertainty of 0.024 after rounding.

2. Once you have determined the number of sig figs in your uncertainty, now round your measured value so the placement of the least significant digit matches that of the rounded uncertainty. Wow, that sounds confusing so let’s see how this applies to our example above:

    + in our example we began with 14.14030407 ± 0.40372678 cm. We determined that the uncertainty should be 0.4 cm, meaning the least significant digit of the uncertainty is in the 1st decimal place. We need to round our measurement value to the same digit so the value we will report for our measurement is **14.1 ± 0.4 cm**. In this example, note that the value 14.1 cm happens to end with the digit 1 -- the number of decimal places in the value is determined by the number of decimal places in the uncertainty. There is no "ending in a 1 or 2 exception" for the value itself, only for rounding the uncertainty.

# Checkpoint for Module 0

Your checkpoint for this week (submitted on Gradescope) will include the following:

+ Your best estimate, with uncertainty, for the distance the ball landed from the ramp, based on your own results
+ Your best estimate of the distance and uncertainty from the class results
+ Answers to the following questions:
    - What were the primary sources of uncertainty that you found it essential to control to obtain accurate results in this experiment (explain)? Please limit your response to 2-3 sentences.
    - Do your results and those of the class as a whole appear reasonable? What basis are you using to reach this conclusion? Please limit your response to 1-3 sentences.
