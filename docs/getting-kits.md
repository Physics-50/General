The kits for module 1 will be available in the Jacobs-Keck Courtyard on Tuesday, January 18 from 9:30am - 5:00pm. 

If you are not on campus and will not be able to collect your kit on this date please reach out to your section instructor.

If you will be on campus later in the week, if possible please ask a friend to collect a kit for you or reach out to your section instructor to make an alternate plan.

If you will not be able to come to campus during the first week of classes you will need to find alternate materials for week 1. This is not a problem, in fact you can complete this experiment with many household supplies. The materials in the kit consist of a personal chalkboard (ramp), a small container with a cork bottom from a coaster and some bags of bolts of varying mass (100g, 200g, 300g) that can be combined in varying ways to change the total mass in the container, a roll of tape, string and a binder clip. 

What you need if you aren't able to make it to campus and need to find your own supplies:

+ Something you can use as a ramp. It needs to be large enough to have room for your phone and your container

+ something you can use as a container

+ 5 different masses you can add. The masses we provide will be labelled with their mass. If you are finding your own supplies you may not have a way to weigh them. This is okay but make sure you have a way of identifying what was added. For example, you might add metal spoons to a container. You might then present your final results as a plot of the coefficient of static friction v.s. number of spoons added.

+ tape (to attach your phone to the ramp)

The other supplies (string and binder clip) are optional. They were included in case you find them helpful for increasing your control as you raise the ramp but are not necessary.
