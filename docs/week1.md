We begin our investigation of measuring $$\mu_s$$ by doing an initial exploration. Our goal is to come up with a hypothesis to test and a plan for how we will do so (an experimental design). In the Exploratory Phase it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook and data spreadsheet can be tricky, so for Week 1 we are providing a [template for you to follow along with that we've assigned from Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2NjQ0NDEyMTAx/a/MTI3ODQ4MDY2NDMx/details){:target="_blank"}. 

**Make sure you have this spreadsheet and your Module 1 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this Week 1 page.**

## Preface
If you have any questions working through this course remotely we encourage you to reach out through the class Piazza site or come to office hours. [Sign up for the class Piazza site](https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2021/ph50)

Before diving into data collection and analysis we would like to set some expectations. This course centers around the collection, analysis, and communication of experimental data and results. We expect all of these to be conducted with care and integrity.

Collaboration:
We expect every student to perform the data analysis, miniquestions, checkpoints, and deliverables for themselves. If you would like to discuss with a classmate (either a roommate or via Zoom) while doing measurements/analysis in parallel, we encourage that type of collaboration! It will likely not save you any time, but often working through material together gives a better learning experience. Just remember that each of you needs to do your own measurements and analysis.

To make sure we all start on the same page please answer the following mini-questions (mini-questions will appear through this manual and are required. Please see the syllabus for more information regarding mini-questions).

Data Collection:
Please make sure you read the tips for Electronic lab notebooks in the syllabus. We emphasize that your notebook is a record of the experiment. Deleting experimental data from a lab notebook is never acceptable. However, it is acceptable to remeasure/reanalyze data because of an inaccurate or incorrect initial analysis. This includes recollecting data with an improved experimental procedure. An example of an acceptable procedure would be: 

You are trying to time how fast your little brother can run. Initially you do this in your hallway but you realize you are getting inaccurate results. You take him to a track and restart the experiment in a way that is less sensitive to the initial conditions. You make a note next to the data you collected with a procedure you believe to be less reliable and then focus on the newly collected data in your analysis, but you do not delete the original data from your lab notebook.

Sometimes it might not be clear what is acceptable. When in doubt please ask!

You may find yourself in a situation where it isn't as clear what is acceptable as the examples we provided. When in doubt please ask. Both the class Piazza discussion board and office hours are great ways to reach out with questions!

## Background Reading

Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. We are measuring the coefficient of static friction: a dimensionless number that depends on the two surfaces in contact. This video from Prof. Arlett on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide some background and a quick refresher:
[<img src="images/static-friction-video-preview.png" alt="refresher on how mu_s is related to theta_c" width="400"/>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19qMGg5rJfkDCQVHRK2G1Nl4_CAMSgvHX/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} 

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result.

## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which of factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

#### Miniquestion: Critical Angle Factors
[*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfsx8s07WCsCfoSiP2k2TAldJ-59ZFq16UpUFlPugfHGEq38w/viewform){:target="_blank"}

Based on this answer, try to come up with some hypotheses you could try to test. The theory makes specific predictions, and you can use those predictions to form the basis of a hypothesis. Post some of your ideas and check out others [on the "Hypotheses" note on Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/kdyuyniyaz052s?cid=7){:target="_blank"}.

**For Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis. The hypothesis we will test is:**

*"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle at which an object slips is independent of its mass."*

## Instrumentation

Now that we've decided what we hypothesis we are going to test, we need to figure out what equipment and experimental tools we are going to use. For this module, we are going to make use of whatever you have on hand. 

You will need a "block" and a "ramp" (e.g. a hard pencil case on a hardcover textbook) that satisfy the following requirements:

+ both items need to have flat, rigid surfaces
+ when you tilt the ramp, the block needs to slide without rolling or tipping
+ a way to add mass to the block without changing the surfaces in contact between the block and ramp

Share your ideas and check out what others are doing at [Piazza: Instrumentation for Module 1](https://piazza.com/class/kdyuyniyaz052s?cid=8){:target="_blank"}.

To measure the angle we will use your phone or a tablet as the tool. Please go to [phyphox.org](https://phyphox.org){:target="_blank"} (or to the app store on your device) and download the phyphox app. After downloading, find the "Inclination" tool and test that it works correctly with your phone.

<img src="images/phyphox.png" alt="phyphox.org inclination tool" width="400"/>

Make note of your equipment in your lab notebook (record keeping is so important) and record any other notes you think might be helpful if someone else was trying to replicate your setup. 

## Exploratory Measurements

The exploratory measurements can be a fun part of the experimental process. You get to play around with your setup and make some observations! You can really let your curiosity and creativity guide you in this part of the experimental process. 

For your exploratory measurements in Module 1, we would like you to do the following:

+ Perform a single measurement to check that you are getting a reasonable answer

+ Get an understanding of the repeatability of your measurement 

+ Perform a preliminary test of your hypothesis

+ Check other factors that might affect your measurement (this is where you get to play!)

The steps below guide you through these four items, and provide links to important concepts (so please follow along carefully). Make sure you are recording your exploratory observations as you go so that you have a record of them (reminder: we have set up [a spreadsheet for you on Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MTI2NjQ0NDEyMTAx/a/MTI3ODQ4MDY2NDMx/details){:target="_blank"}, use the "Exploratory Observations" tab to record your data in this section).


#### 1 Perform a Single Measurement

Usually one of the first exploratory steps is to use your equipment to take a single measurement. We want to make sure that our measurement (in this case, $$\theta_c$$) will lead to a reasonable value of the calculated quantity we are trying to obtain ($$\mu_s$$). We also want to get a sense of the resolution of our measurement device and how that will affect the uncertainty measured in the calculated quantity. 

+ Place the block on the ramp and slowly raise the ramp while keeping an eye on the plane inclination measurement on the phyphox app. Record in the spreadsheet the value of the angle you observe just before slipping (in other words, perform a single measurement of $$\theta_c$$).


+ The "Uncertainty Introduction" has information we are going to need in Ph50 about treating sources of experimental uncertainty. Please first read both the [overview on uncertainties](uncertainty-introduction#overview){:target="_blank"} and also about [resolution uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#resolution-uncertainty){:target="_blank"} ($$\approx$$ 5 minutes).  

    Then record the resolution uncertainty for the critical angle $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c$$ in your exploratory observations spreadsheet.

| $$\theta_c$$ (degrees) | $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c $$ (degrees) |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
 | ...            |   ... |


+ Calculate $$\mu_s$$ from your single measurement of $$\theta_c$$ (using the relationship you derived in the [background reading](#background-reading)). 

*Friendly reminder: convert the angle from degrees to radians in your Google Sheet calculation. **You also need to convert your uncertainty in the angle from degrees to radians in the same manner**.*

+ Learn how to propagate uncertainties from this video of Prof. Gerbode explaining how to propagate uncertainty in $$\theta_c$$ to uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ and answer the mini-question below

#### Miniquestion: Uncertainty Propagation

------------------------------

After watching the video from Prof. Gerbode, let's return to your measurement of $$\mu_s$$ from $$\theta_c$$:

+  Calculate the resolution uncertainty in measuring the coefficient of static friction $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s$$ by propagating your uncertainty $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \theta_c$$. Derive any formulas you use in your lab notebook.

| $$\mu_s$$  | $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s $$ |
|:-----------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:|
 | ...            |   ... |


Comment on whether your measured value is reasonable (e.g. is $$\mu_s$$ within the limits of allowable values, i.e. between 0 and infinity?  With a quick google search, is it similar to $$\mu_s$$ for similar surfaces? Is your fractional resolution uncertainty reasonably small,  (fractional resolution uncertainty $$\equiv \frac{\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s}{\mu_s}<<1$$)? In other words, confirm that the uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ less than the value of $$\mu_s$$ itself?

*At this point, if your answer were to be unreasonable or you were unable to calculate the quantity you are interested in testing (in our case $$\mu_s$$), then it would be a good idea to carefully rethink your measurement. Doing this initial single measurement and check can save a lot of time, especially when the experimental setup gets more complicated as it will later in the course. If you're stuck, [post a question up on our Piazza site](https://piazza.com/class/kdyuyniyaz052s){:target="_blank"} and [come to Office Hours](https://sakai.claremont.edu/portal/site/CX_mtg_130832/page/8bb99f43-12a4-4f97-8e47-802814328a26){:target=_"blank"}*

Before you submit Checkpoint 1, let's first double-check your procedure. Using the exact same procedure as you did to calculate your $$\mu_s$$  and  $$\delta_\mathrm{res.} \mu_s $$ above, complete the following miniquestion with a different measurement of $$\theta_c$$:
