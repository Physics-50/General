## Reporting Data with Significant Figures

Something to consider when communicating your results is the number of significant figures (decimal places) you report. Imagine you calculated the mean value for the distance from the table and its uncertainty. The value you obtain from Google Sheets is 14.14030407 ± 0.40372678, and remember that we reported the number of centimeters (cm). So you should communicate this value when you write up your experimental results, right? Hold on:  do you really know the value of d to the 8th decimal place? Our uncertainty of $$\delta d = $$0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 cm tells us that we are unsure of the 1st decimal place, so we are definitely not sure about the value in the 8th decimal place of $$d = $$14.1403040<span style="color:red">7</span> cm! This digit is insignificant; you don’t truly have that kind of precision in this experiment and cannot quote results that would imply otherwise.

This is where the term significant figures, or “sig figs” for short, comes into play. We only want to report digits that are significant — accurately reflect the precision of our experiment — in our results. 

Here are the two steps to follow to determine significant digits:

1. Round and keep only one digit in your uncertainty.

    + in our example this would mean we report our uncertainty as $$\delta d = 0.4$$ cm

    **Exception**: if the most significant digit (i.e., the first nonzero digit) — in our example above, the digit in red 0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 — is a 1 or 2, then report two digits in the uncertainty. For example: if your uncertainty is 0.0237304 then its most significant digit is a 2 so we will keep two digits, resulting in an uncertainty of 0.024 after rounding.

2. Once you have determined the number of sig figs in your uncertainty, now round your measured value so the placement of the least significant digit matches that of the rounded uncertainty. Wow, that sounds confusing so let’s see how this applies to our example above:

    + in our example we began with 14.14030407 ± 0.40372678 cm. We determined that the uncertainty should be 0.4 cm, meaning the least significant digit of the uncertainty is in the 1st decimal place. We need to round our measurement value to the same digit so the value we will report for our measurement is **14.1 ± 0.4 cm**. In this example, note that the value 14.1 cm happens to end with the digit 1 -- the number of decimal places in the value is determined by the number of decimal places in the uncertainty. There is no "ending in a 1 or 2 exception" for the value itself, only for rounding the uncertainty.
