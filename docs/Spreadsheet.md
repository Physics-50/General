### Step 1: Set-up a Spreadsheet

Here are some general guidelines for setting up a spreadsheet. We use the week 2 spreadsheet for Module 1 as an example. Note that we've done some of these steps for you in the template we have provided.

Your spreadsheet should allow you to:
+ Record data.
+ Plot your data in real time.
+ Analyze your data. In this case your goal is to determine the co-efficient of static friction for each mass.

Look back to the spreadsheet you used for your preliminary data collection last week. You will want to organize your data collection in a similar way.

These steps will guide you through this process:


1. Begin by creating a new sheet in your worksheet for this module using the add sheet button in the bottom left.
2. Set up a table to determine the critical angle for the first mass.

    + Give the table a title.

    + Title the column you will be using for data collection ($$\theta_c$$)

    + Use the borders feature to outline the table.

3. Set up a graph to plot your data in real time. For this experiment you will want to plot a histogram of your measurements of the the critical angle $$\theta_c$$. Today we are setting up an informal plot to look at our data in real time. This is different from a more formal figure that you would use to share/communicate your results --- creating formal figures is a more careful process, we will do that next week after we've collected and reflected on our data. Here we summarize how to create a histogram in sheets. You can find more helpful information at: [*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/9146867?hl=en){:target="_blank"}

    + You can add a chart by selecting "insert" and then "chart" from the drop down menus.

    + A new “Chart Editor” menu will appear on the RHS of the screen. Use the drop down menu under chart type to select “histogram”.

    + On the next line of the “Chart Editor” set data range to be the cells in which you plan to insert your data (you may have to go back and edit this later if you collect more data than expected).

    + Press the x in the top right to exit the chart editor.

    + Click on your chart and move it to a convenient spot in your worksheet. You will want to customize the chart further once you begin collecting data.

5. Now add a row to calculate the average value for the critical angle, $$\theta_c$$, and standard error. This will be analogous to what you did last week just with more data, go ahead and look back to last week’s worksheet to set-up the calculations.

6. Add another row to use the same calculations you did last week to calculate the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, for your new data set.

7. Now you need to set up your worksheet to collect data for the second mass. There are two ways you might go about this. One is to add a second column to the right of your first column, duplicating the equations for your calculations. You should then create a second histogram to monitor the data from the second mass in real time. Alternatively, you can duplicate the sheet. At the bottom left are tabs that allow you to have multiple sheets in your worksheet. If you click on the downward arrow next to your sheet name a menu will appear. Click on “duplicate” and you will now have a second identical sheet ready for data from your second mass. You can rename your sheets from the same menu.

Once you have collected a few data points you will want to go back to the chart editor and select customize. Next week we will focus on polishing our plot for communicating our results but even for your own records you want to make a few adjustments while collecting data.

+ Use the Chart and axis title dropdown to add a chart title

+ Within the same dropdown menu, if you click on chart title you can change the dropdown to “Horizontal axis title”. Go ahead and label your axis.

+ The histogram dropdown will allow you to change the bucket size (by default it will be on auto which you may or may not find satisfactory depending on your data)
