## Assembling the figure in Powerpoint
To create your two-panel figure for the Module 1 deliverable, we recommend using Powerpoint to assemble the parts. If you don't have Powerpoint installed, you can [get it free from HMC CIS here](https://www.hmc.edu/cis/services/office-365-education-for-students/).


Open a new Powerpoint presentation and insert both the images you have made (the plot you've created and a photo of your setup).

For a scale bar, you will need to measure the length of a reference object (e.g., in real life, the tuna can is 8.5 cm in diameter). Then you can Insert->Shapes->Line in Powerpoint and make a scale bar of an appropriate size.

Insert text boxes to label the panels (a) and (b).

Then insert a text box for the caption. Advice for preparing a caption was provided [here](week3#a-figure-showing-a-plot).
When you’re satisfied with how the figure looks, select all of the objects on the slide, right click and “Save As Picture”. You now have a saved figure file (save as either .png or .jpg for Gradescope submission please).
