# Module 0

Module 0 is not a full module but a one-week experiment with a checkpoint (no deliverable). There are also no mini-questions this week and most of the instruction and discussion will take place in lab.

Please note that in order for the Google classroom link below to work you must first go to Google Classroom through a Chrome browser logged into your g.hmc.edu account and join the class with classroom code: **cztaii7**  - or use this [link](https://classroom.google.com/c/MzY5MzA2OTcxNzM4?cjc=cztaii7). After you've done this once you will not have to log into Google classroom separately again and all links to documents we provide through Google classroom in this lab manual will work.

Please make sure to join Google classroom from your g.hmc.edu account. Students from other Claremont colleges taking the course should consult HMC's CIS support if you have any issues - they will issue you a g.hmc.edu account. **The course will not appear in your Google Classroom account until you join the course with the class code.**

**Make sure you have this spreadsheet and your Module 0 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this page. Please note that we require you to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook. The shared spreadsheet will make it easier for us to troubleshoot if any issues come up and provides a historical record of your data collection. The spreadsheet/lab notebook assigned through Google classroom are the only documents you will have access to for the practicum at the end of the course. It is acceptable for lab partners to use one spreadsheet for collecting data. However, if you do so the partner whose spreadsheet was not used for data collection must 1) make a note in their spreadsheet stating that the data was originally collected in your lab partner's notebook and 2) ensure you have a copy of the complete data set pasted into your own Google classroom assigned spreadsheet before leaving lab. Discussion and collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but both partners are individually responsible for completing their own analysis for the checkpoints and deliverables and submitting their own work.**

Next week we will talk more about carefully setting up and organizing a spreadsheet. For now please ask if you have questions but for now your main goal should be to organize your spreadsheet well enough that you and your partner can keep track of what you've done and would be able to come back several months later and still be able to understand, follow and work with the data.


The experiment: You will roll a ball down a ramp. The ramp should be set to 5°. You need to measure the horizontal distance the ball lands from the end of the ramp, including an estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.

The tape provided on your bench can be used to visualize where the ball landed. 

Please follow the following instructions:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: measure, with uncertainty, the horizontal distance traveled by a ball rolling down an inclined plane placed on top of a lab bench.

Steps:
+ Set the incline of the “ramp” to 5° above the table 
+ Move the lower end of the ramp to the edge of the table
+ Use the blue masking tape to attach a length of pressure sensitive tape (roll of colored paper) to the floor where you anticipate the ball will land
+ Place the ball 1 meter on the ramp from the lower end (measured along the length of the ramp) and release
+ Repeat as often as necessary to obtain a value for the horizontal distance “d” traveled by the ball (measured from the end of the ramp) and the associated uncertainty in “d”

One of our goals in these first few weeks is to become comfortable with what it means to report a value with uncertainty. We've prepared a guide to help you through our expectations but do not expect you to read the full guide today. Please follow [this link, which will open in a new tab](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty){:target="_blank"}. You do not need to read the complete guide, just until the link:

## Return to Module 0 and begin data collection

You should spend ~30 min on an initial estimate. Please submit your estimate and uncertainty on the following form: (only one lab partner should submit your team's result)

Once you have submitted your result please think about how you might obtain a more accurate estimate. Instructions for the rest of lab will be provided in class.

Following the class discussion and further investigations please submit your final estimate here:

Before preparing your checkpoint please read through this guideline for reporting results with appropriate significant figures. You should refer back to these guidelines and follow them throughout this course.

## Reporting Data with Significant Figures

Something to consider when communicating your results is the number of significant figures (decimal places) you report. Imagine you calculated the mean value for the distance from the table and its uncertainty. The value you obtain from Google Sheets is 14.44030407 ± 0.40372678, and remember that we reported the number of centimeters (cm). So you should communicate this value when you write up your experimental results, right? Hold on:  do you really know the value of d to the 8th decimal place? Our uncertainty of $$\delta d = $$0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 cm tells us that we are unsure of the 1st decimal place, so we are definitely not sure about the value in the 8th decimal place of $$d = $$14.4403040<span style="color:red">7</span> cm! This digit is insignificant; you don’t truly have that kind of precision in this experiment and cannot quote results that would imply otherwise.

This is where the term significant figures, or “sig figs” for short, comes into play. We only want to report digits that are significant — accurately reflect the precision of our experiment — in our results. We will now present the rule of thumb for determining significant digits:

1. Round and keep only one digit in your uncertainty

    + in our example this would mean we report our uncertainty as $$\delta d = 0.4$$ cm

    **Exception**: if the most significant digit (i.e., the first nonzero digit) — in our example above, the digit in red 0.<span style="color:red">4</span>0372678 — is a 1 or 2, then report two digits in the uncertainty. For example: if your uncertainty is 0.0237304 then its most significant digit is a 2 so we will keep two digits, resulting in an uncertainty of 0.024 after rounding.

2. Round your measured value so the placement of the least significant digit matches that of the rounded uncertainty. Wow, that sounds confusing so let’s see how this applies to our example above:

    + in our example we began with 14.44030407 ± 0.40372678 cm. We determined that the uncertainty should be 0.4 cm, meaning the least significant digit of the uncertainty is in the 3rd decimal place. We need to round our measurement value to the same digit so the value we will report for our measurement is **14.4 ± 0.4 cm**.

# Checkpoint for Module 0

Your checkpoint for this week (submitted on Gradescope) will include the following:

+ Your best estimate, with uncertainty, for the distance the ball landed from the ramp, based on your own results
+ Your best estimate of the distance and uncertainty from the class results
+ Answers to the following questions:
    - What were the primary sources of uncertainty that you found it essential to control to obtain accurate results in this experiment (explain)? Please limit your response to 2-3 sentences.
    - Do your results and those of the class as a whole appear reasonable? What basis are you using to reach this conclusion? Please limit your response to 1-3 sentences.
