We begin our investigation to measure the coefficient of static friction, $$\mu_s$$, by doing an initial exploration. Our goal is to come up with a hypothesis to test and a plan for how we will do so (an experimental design). In the Exploratory Phase it can be especially important to take detailed notes. Organizing a digital lab notebook and data spreadsheet can be tricky, so for Week 1 we are providing a [template for you to follow along with that we've assigned from Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/u/0/w/MzY5MzA2OTcxNzM4/t/all){:target="_blank"}. 

**Make sure you have this spreadsheet and your Module 1 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this Week 1 page. Remember: you are required to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook.**

## Preface
If you have any questions outside of class, we encourage you to reach out to your classmates through the class Piazza site or come to office hours to talk to an instructor. [You can sign up for the class Piazza site here.](https://piazza.com/hmc/spring2022/ph50)

Before diving into data collection and analysis we would like to set some expectations. This course centers around the collection, analysis, and communication of experimental data and results. We expect all of these to be conducted with care and integrity.

Collaboration:
We expect every student to perform the data analysis, miniquestions, checkpoints, and deliverables for themselves, but you are welcome to discuss your results and analysis with your lab partner and classmates.

To make sure we all start on the same page please answer the following mini-questions (mini-questions will appear throughout this manual and are required to be completed before you arrive in lab each week. Please see the syllabus for more information regarding mini-questions) - mini-questions are interspersed throughout the lab manual and need to be completed before the start of lab.

Data Collection:
Please make sure you read the tips for electronic lab notebooks in the syllabus. We emphasize that your notebook is a record of the experiment. Deleting experimental data from a lab notebook is never acceptable. However, it is acceptable to remeasure/reanalyze data because of inaccurate or incorrect initial efforts. This includes recollecting data with an improved experimental procedure. An example of an acceptable procedure would be: 

You are trying to time how fast your little brother can run. Initially you do this in your hallway but you realize you are getting inaccurate results. You take him to a track and restart the experiment in a way that is less sensitive to the initial conditions. You make a note next to the data you collected with a procedure you believe to be less reliable and then focus on the newly collected data in your analysis, but you do not delete the original data from your lab notebook.

## Background Reading

Often the first step is to do some background reading and theoretical analysis. We are measuring the coefficient of static friction, a dimensionless number that depends on the two surfaces in contact. This video from Prof. Arlett on how $$\mu_s$$ and $$\theta_c$$ are related will provide some background and a quick refresher:
[<img src="images/static-friction-video-preview.png" alt="refresher on how mu_s is related to theta_c" width="400"/>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJCo0SK2Mi3Z8hzRhgZ8WHyLzuaXgzMx/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} 

In your lab notebook, try the derivation yourself and document the result.

## Formulating a Hypothesis

We can now try to think of a hypothesis we can test with an experiment. As a quick check, according to the theory, which factors will affect a measurement of $$\theta_c$$?

#### Miniquestion: Critical Angle Factors
[*Click here to open in a new tab*](https://forms.gle/oUrvxpsg5foNjnVH7){:target="_blank"}

<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFH6ZBvZzAlN_LNJQqnmFCPN97KyLGW44mU-AsTd_XSAxcTw/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="300" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading…

-----

Based on this answer, can you think of any hypotheses you could try to test? 

**While there are many different hypotheses you might consider, for Module 1 we will all test the same hypothesis. The hypothesis we will test is:**

*"The coefficient of static friction between two surfaces as measured by the critical angle at which an object slips is independent of the mass of the sliding object."*

## Instrumentation

Now that we've decided what hypothesis we are going to test, we need to figure out what equipment and experimental tools we are going to use. For this module, a ramp, container, and different masses that can be placed in the container will be provided at your lab bench. 

To measure the angle you will use your phone and the **Phyphox** App. Please go to [phyphox.org](https://phyphox.org){:target="_blank"} (or to the app store on your device) and download the phyphox app. Try to do this before you come to class for the first day of lab. After downloading, find the "Inclination" tool and test that it works correctly with your phone.

<img src="images/phyphox.png" alt="phyphox.org inclination tool" width="400"/>

Make note of your equipment in your lab notebook (record keeping is important) and record any other notes you think might be helpful if someone else was trying to replicate your setup. Remember: for the praciticum you will only have access to your Google-classroom-assigned lab notebook and data sheet.

## Exploratory Measurements

The exploratory measurements can be a fun part of the experimental process. You get to play around with your setup and make some observations! You can really let your curiosity and creativity guide you in this part of the experimental process. 

For your exploratory measurements in Module 1, we would like you to do the following:

+ Perform a single measurement to check that you are getting a reasonable answer

+ Get an understanding of the repeatability of your measurement 

+ Check other factors that might affect your measurement and its reproducibility (this is where you get to play!)

The steps below guide you through these three items, and provide links to important concepts (so please follow along carefully). Make sure you are recording your exploratory observations as you go so that you have a record of them (reminder: we have set up [a spreadsheet for you on Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/MjUxNTgyMzY1MDM5/a/MjUxNTgyMzY1MDQ5/details){:target="_blank"}, use the "Exploratory Observations" tab to record your data in this section).

#### In lab: Perform a Single Measurement

Usually one of the first exploratory steps is to use your equipment to take a single measurement. We want to make sure that our measurement (in this case, $$\theta_c$$) will lead to a reasonable value of the calculated quantity we are trying to obtain ($$\mu_s$$). We also want to get a sense of the resolution of our measurement device and how that will affect the uncertainty measured in the calculated quantity. 

+ Place the block on the ramp and slowly raise the ramp while keeping an eye on the plane inclination measurement on the phyphox app. You can choose how much mass to place in the block for this first measurement, but to get a representative initial value it is helpful to avoid extremes, i.e. add some mass to the container but don't overload it. Record in the spreadsheet the value of the angle you observe just before slipping (in other words, perform a single measurement of $$\theta_c$$).

+ Calculate $$\mu_s$$ from your single measurement of $$\theta_c$$ (using the relationship derived in the [background reading](#background-reading)). 

*Friendly reminder: convert the angle from degrees to radians in your Google Sheet calculation. 

Comment on whether your measured value is reasonable (e.g. is $$\mu_s$$ within the limits of allowable values, i.e. between 0 and infinity?  With a quick google search, is it similar to $$\mu_s$$ for similar surfaces? 

## Introduction to Experimental Uncertainty

The "Uncertainty Introduction" has information we are going to need in Ph50 about treating sources of experimental uncertainty. For this week please read the [overview on uncertainties](uncertainty-introduction-overview-only){:target="_blank"}.  This is an excerpt from a more extended guide that we will return to in later sections. 

## Reproducibility

Read [this discussion about random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty) 

The goal of testing repeatability is to get a sense of the random error associated with the measurement. 

Take a few (maybe five) measurements of $$\theta_c$$ under identical conditions. Make sure you "reset" your experimental setup each time: start the ramp from a horizontal position ($$\theta = 0$$), place the block onto the ramp, and then slowly start to raise the ramp. "Resetting" the experimental setup between trials helps to randomize systematic error.

Trial #	| $$\theta_c$$ (degrees)	
|:-------:|:-------------------------:|	
1 |			
2	|		
3	|		
4	|		


Using the information provided in the [discussion on random uncertainty](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty), calculate the standard error of the mean [SEM] for your data.
    
Reducing random uncertainty can include both improving our measurement technique to reduce the spread in our data and  taking many repeated trials. It is often helpful to do both. This is also your chance to take some initiative. The approach you use to measure the angle at which the container begins to slip will significantly affect the reproducibility. Materials will be provided at the back of the lab to allow you to raise the ramp in different ways. You should give some consideration to how to reliably determine the critical angle - trying to press a button on your phone as the container is starting to move while holding the ramp is unlikely to yield reproducible results. Use the remaining time to explore techniques that might help you to get more reproducible results. If you aren't sure where to start talk to your instructor. Some ideas to consider - you may find equipment at the back of the lab that allows you to raise the ramp in a more controllable way (e.g. you will find equipment that you could use to construct a pulley system), you may also find it helpful to know that Phyphox will record the data for later extraction. If you know the critical angle was the highest angle reached you don't need to press any buttons on the phone during the experiment. Alternatively you might consider recording the screen of your phone and the container with a second phone to be able to go back and more accurately determine the moment at which the container began to slip. Designing/setting up the experiment in a way that will allow you to get reproducible results is a critical part of the experimental process and of this course.

You can get some additional practice propagating uncertainty [here](uncertainty-introduction#extra-practice)

## Propagation of Your Experimental Uncertainty

After watching the video from Prof. Gerbode, let's return to your measurement of $$\mu_s$$ from $$\theta_c$$:

+  Calculate the uncertainty in your measurement of the coefficient of static friction $$\delta_{\mu_s}$$ by propagating your uncertainty $$\delta_{\theta_c}$$ (where $$\delta_{\theta_c}$$ is the SEM of your measured values). Derive any formulas you use in your lab notebook. Your calculation of $$\delta_{\mu_s}$$ should appear in your Google Sheets notebook. Remember that we expect your calculations to be done within Google sheets, i.e. in order to receive full credit for your work you should use built in functions in Google Sheets to do the math and not a calculator.

 Is your fractional uncertainty reasonable,  (fractional resolution uncertainty $$\equiv \frac{\delta_\mu_s}{\mu_s} \ll 1$$)? In other words, confirm that the uncertainty in $$\mu_s$$ less than the value of $$\mu_s$$ itself?

At this point, if your answer were to be unreasonable or you were unable to calculate the quantity you are interested in testing (in our case $$\mu_s$$), then it would be a good idea to carefully rethink your measurement. Doing this initial single measurement and check can save a lot of time, especially when the experimental setup gets more complicated as it will later in the course. One of the goals of this course is that you take the time to think about careful experimental procedure. You will be graded on your quality of data as part of your deliverable at the end of each module. If you feel there may be issues with your results but are  unsure how to improve your procedure, speak to your instructor.

Let's double-check your calculation. Using the exact same method that you set up to calculate your $$\mu_s$$  and  $$\delta_\mathrm{res} \mu_s $$ above, complete the following miniquestion with an example measurement of $$\theta_c$$:

## Significant Figures when Reporting Results

## What you need to leave lab with:

+ You should have a procedure for collecting data in which you have made an effort to improve the reproducibility of your measurements. This is an important first step to being able to test our hypothesis next week.

+ You should have a set of 5 data points -  all collected with the same mass in the container, using the procedure you settled on to improve reproducibility. This is the data you will use when completing the checkpoint.
 
## Checkpoint 1

Weekly checkpoints are submitted on Gradescope. This week's checkpoint is submitted in two parts. 

**Part 1: Practice calculation**

*You may resubmit Module 2, checkpoint 1, Part 1 as many times as you like until you get the correct answer (it is auto-graded and will give you an immediate response). For this part **only** it is also okay to "save" your responses to the individual questions.*

 You should do part 1 before part 2. **You may find it helpful to attempt part 1 before your time in lab.**

Part 1 is a sample calculation to ensure you are calculating $$\mu_s$$ and propagating the uncertainty correctly. The sample calculation will provide real time feedback. This is to ensure you know how to do the calculation before analyzing your data. It is not an honor code violation to make changes after receiving the feedback before submission.

**Part 2: Post-lab analysis**

**In order to provide timely feedback, and considering that different sections have work due on different days. We will frequently return work before all students have submitted their work. To make this work with the constraints of using a shared Gradescope portal for all sections, we cannot accept resubmissions in this course (except when specifically indicated such as part 1 above). Please prepare your assignment in a separate document. When you are ready to submit your work, enter all entries into Gradescope in a single sitting without using the "save" button and then make use of the "submit" button to submit your work. You may not resubmit your work once it has been submitted (and saving in Gradescope is equivalent to submitting). Your instructor will go over this policy on the first day of class. If you have questions please ask.**


+ You will be asked to submit your measured critical angle, coefficient of friction, and propagated uncertainty. This data should come from data you collected after settling on a procedure to yield reproducible data and should include averaging 5 data points. All 5 data points should have been collected with the same mass in the container.

+ You will also be asked to describe the procedure you have settled on to accurately determine the critical angle.

And to double-check, make sure you have finished all of this week's mini-questions by [checking here](mini-questions#week-1){:target="_blank"}

## Sample Rubric for Grading of Checkpoint 1

We are providing a draft grading rubric (we will only do this for Module 1, after that we hope you will have a clear idea of our expectations). These deductions are intended primarily to ensure you are prepared for week 2 and to be successful in the module. We may occasionally include small deductions. Please don't assume that because a deduction is small it isn't important. It may be for an important error that we chose not to take off points for at an early stage in the course but are more likely to deduct points for next time. Since the deductions are intended to provide feedback to help you be successful on future checkpoints, if you don't understand our suggestions, please stop by office hours to talk to us.

The checkpoint is graded out of 10.5 points.

**Anticipated week 1 checkpoint deductions:**
+ Sample Calculations: Incorrect result for $$\mu_s$$ [-1 point]
+ Sample Calculation: Incorrect result for the propagated resolution uncertainty [-1 point]
+ Sample Calculation: Incorrect result for the propagated uncertainty including random error [-1 point]
+ Reported critical angle departs substantially from expectations [-2 points]
+ Reported uncertainty in the critical angle departs substantially from expectations [-1 point]
+ Link to shared Google classroom spreadsheet not provided [-1 point]
+ $$\mu_s$$ calculated incorrectly [-1.5 points]
+ Propagated uncertainty departs substantially from expectations and/or calculated incorrectly [-1.5 point]
+ Varying deductions if your procedure does not adequately lay out a method to generate reproducible measurements of the critical angle [up to 3 points]
+ Deductions for not following the conventions for significant figures laid out in the lab manual last week [up to 2 points]
+ Deductions for failing to submit the checkpoint on time as outlined in the syllabus
