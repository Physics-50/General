**Please note that use of the provided plotting script for plotting your data is required, plots in Google sheets do not meet course expectations.**

To plot your data you first need to generate a .CSV file containing only your data. You can do this from within your Google Sheets spreadsheet.

You may surround algebraic variables and Greek letters with dollar signs; e.g., $\theta$ (Â°) or $L$ (cm) or $T^2$ (s$^2$) or $L_{\rm string}$ (cm), where \rm allows you to use roman text within a mathetmatical formula.
