# Module 0

Module 0 is not a full module but a one week experiment with a checkpoint (no deliverable). There are also no mini-questions this week and most of the instruction and discussion will take place in lab.

Please note that in order for the Google classroom link below to work you must first go to Google Classroom through a Chrome browser logged into your g.hmc.edu account and join the class with classroom code: cztaii7  - or use this [link](https://classroom.google.com/c/MzY5MzA2OTcxNzM4?cjc=cztaii7). Once you've done this once you will not have to log into Google classroom separately again and all links to documents we provide through Google classroom in this lab manual will work.

Please make sure to join Google classroom from your g.hmc.edu account. Students from other Claremont colleges taking the course should consult HMC's CIS support if you have any issues - they will issue you a g.hmc.edu account. **The course will not appear in your Google Classroom account until you join the course with the class code.**

**Make sure you have this spreadsheet and your Module 0 Lab Notebook handy as you go through the content on this page. Please note that we require you to use the provided spreadsheet/lab notebook. The shared spreadsheet will make it easier for us to troubleshoot if any issues come up and provides a historical record of your data collection. The spreadsheet/lab notebook assigned through Google classroom are the only documents you will have access to for the practicum at the end of the course. It is acceptable for lab partners to use one spreadsheet for collecting data. However, if you do so the partner whose spreadsheet was not used for data collection must 1) make a note in their spreadsheeting stating that the data was originally collected in your lab partners notebook and 2) Ensure you have a copy of the complete data set pasted into your own Google classroom assinged spreadsheet before leaving lab. Discussion and collaboration is permitted and encouraged, but both partners are individually responsible for completing your own analysis for the checkpoints and deliverables and submitting your own work.**

Next week we will talk more about carefully setting up and organizing a spreadsheet. For now please ask if you have questions but for now your main goal should be to organize your spreadsheet well enough that you and your partner can keep track of what you've done and would be able to come back several months later and still be able to understand, follow and work with the data.


The experiment: You will roll a ball down a ramp. The ramp should be set to 5$$^{\circ}$$. You need to measure the horizontal distance the ball lands from the end of the ramp, including an estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.

The tape provided on your bench can be used to visualize where the ball landed. 

Please follow the following instructions:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goal: measure, with uncertainty, the horizontal distance traveled by a ball rolling down an inclined plane placed on top of a lab bench.

Steps:
+ Set the incline of the “ramp” to 5 degrees above the table 
+ Move the lower end of the ramp to the edge of the table
+ Use the blue masking tape to attach a length of pressure sensitive tape (roll of colored paper) to the floor where you anticipate the ball will land
+ Place the ball 1 meter on the ramp from the lower end (measured along the length of the ramp) and release
+ Repeat as often as necessary to obtain a value for the horizontal distance “d” traveled by the ball (measured from the end of the ramp) and the associated uncertainty in “d”

One of our goals in these first few weeks is to become comfortable with what it means to report a value with uncertainty. We've prepared a guide to help you through our expectations but do not expect you to read the full guide today. Please follow [this link, which will open in a new tab](uncertainty-introduction#random-uncertainty){:target="_blank"}. You do not need to read the complete guide, just until the link:

## Return to Module 0 and begin data collection

You should spend ~30min on an initial estimate. Please submit your estimate and uncertainty on the following form: (only one lab partner should submit your team's result)

Once you have submitted your result please think about how you might obtain a more accurate estimate. Instructions for the rest of lab will be provided in class.

Following the class discussion and further investigations please submit your final estimate here:

# Checkpoint for module 1.5

Your checkpoint for this week (submitted on Gradescope) will include the following:

+ Your best estimate, with uncertainty, for the distance the ball landed from the ramp, based on your own results
+ Your best estimate of the distance and uncertainty from the class results
+ Answers to the following questions:
    - What were the primary sources of uncertainty that you found it essential to control to obtain accurate results in this experiment (explain)? Please limit your response to 2-3 sentences.
    - Do your results and those of the class as a whole appear reasonable? What basis are you using to reach this conclusion? Please limit your response to 1-2 sentences.
