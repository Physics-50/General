# Preamble
Our goal in this course is for you to focus on the experimental process rather than racing to complete a list of tasks in a tight time frame. In each module you should first follow directions to gain familiarity with a broad set of equipment, techniques, and phenomena.  In each module we will then guide you to take opportunities to investigate some aspect of the situation more deeply. Your ultimate task is to communicate the results of your experimental research.

In order to be successful in this course you:
+ are actively engaged and reach out for help when you get stuck 
+ complete mini-questions, checkpoints, and deliverables on time
+ document your work as you go along
+ design an experiment and carry it out, refine your methods along the way, go back and address major problems--do something, think about it, improve upon it
+ reflect on your results, identify main limitations and correct glaring omissions, identify any questions that your results raise
+ think about the next questions that would arise in the next iteration of the experiment 
+ present your final results without major factual errors that undermine your credibility 
+ tell the story about why you did what you did and what conclusions you can draw

If we (your instructors) could do all of these all of the time we would be better physicists and probably better people in general. We are looking for you to demonstrate competence in these areas; we do not expect perfection.

By the end of this course you will be able to collect, analyze, and interpret real measured data in an ethical manner and draw meaningful conclusions from personal observations of the physical world. Knowing what questions to ask and what pitfalls to be on the lookout for is not always easy and is something of an art. To help you to be successful we will provide a large amount of guidance in the earlier labs, prompting you often to stop and think about various aspects of your experiment. As the semester progresses we will gradually taper off the guidance, and we will begin to focus more on how to best communicate your results. Scientific communication is an essential part of doing experimental research.


# Course Structure
In this course you will work on three modules that each will last several weeks. (There is also a 1 week experiment without a deliverable, referred to as module 0, the first week of class). In each week of each module, you will start by reading the online manual (linked on Sakai) and completing the associated embedded miniquestions, due by the start of your lab period (there are no mini-questions the first week of class) Each week you will submit a checkpoint via Gradescope, due four days later. 

Deadlines for checkpoints will be as follows:
Monday sections: due Fridays at 10pm
Wednesday sections: due Sundays at 10pm
Thursday sections: due Mondays at 10pm
Friday sections: due Tuesdays at 10pm

Finally, at the end of each module you will submit a module deliverable via Gradescope. Deadlines for the deliverables will follow the same calendar.


# Reading and miniquestions
Each week you will start by going to the module website (linked from Sakai). There you will find detailed procedures and lab instructions, with miniquestions embedded throughout the text. These miniquestions are intended to help you quickly confirm your understanding of what you are reading and should be completed as you are reading. **Each week you are expected to read through the material for the week and complete the embedded mini-questoins before the start of lab in order to be prepared to use your time efficiently in class.** After submission of a miniquestion, if your answer is incorrect you will be prompted to resubmit your answer. In order to receive credit for your resubmission, you must explain why your new answer is correct. When resubmitting remember that your goal is not to describe what you did wrong but rather to explain and clarify the correct answer.

# Weekly checkpoints:
Each week you will complete a weekly checkpoint and submit it via Gradescope. Take any deductions on checkpoints seriously even if they are small. By the end of the module we expect that any issues will be addressed in your final deliverable. Come to office hours to discuss your checkpoint feedback, we are here to help!

# Module deliverables
The end-of-module deliverables focus on the critical skill of scientific communication. In physics, the process of writing often begins with creating a sequence of figures with captions. This visual outlining procedure lays the groundwork for all the details that eventually fill in the space in between the figures. The module deliverables are structured to guide you through this physics writing process. Detailed instructions for each deliverable will be provided in each module website (linked from Sakai), but briefly:

+ For Module I, you will create a multi-panel figure with a caption that summarizes the result of your experiment. 
+ For Modules II and III, you will create a sequence of 2 multi-panel figures that, along with captions, effectively tell the story of your experiment: what you did, and what your results mean. 

There is no deliverable for module 0.

# Grading
The course grade will be calculated based upon your performance on the mini-questions, checkpoints, deliverables and in-lab practicum.

Final grades will be determined as follows:
+ Timely completion of the reading miniquestions: 10%
+ Checkpoints: 25%
+ Deliverables: 45%
+ Practicum: 20%

All modules must be satisfactorily completed to pass this course. 

# Absence from class
Please do not attend class if you are ill or subject to quarantine due to possible COVID-19 exposure. Please do reach out to your instructor as soon as you know (or expect) you will be unable to attend class and we will work with you to make alternate arrangements including no-penalty extensions. Apart from absences due to illness (including quarantining due to possible COVID-19 exposure with or without illness) attendance at all class meetings is expected/required.

# Late Policy
Late work will be accepted within the windows listed below with the following deductions. These deductions are based on the available points for the item, not your score:

## Miniquestions
Mini-questions are intended to help you prepare for your time in lab and are due at the start of lab. We therefore do not offer extensions on mini-questions.

## Checkpoints and Deliverables
+ Up to 5 hours past the deadline: 5%
+ Up to 24 hours past the deadline: 10%
+ Up to 48 hours past the deadline: 15%
+ Up to 72 hours past the deadline: 20%

 You may have two extensions of up to 24 hours without penalty over the course of the semester, provided you let us know in advance by e-mailing jarlett@hmc.edu that you would like the assignment to count for one of these extensions. The extensions may be used for checkpoints or deliverables (but not mini-questions). If you are experiencing extenuating circumstances please don't hesitate to reach out. 

# Online Resources
The course website is available on Sakai, where you will find links to each Module of the course in the side menu of the Physics 50 page. Also linked from that page are Gradescope and Piazza. You will submit the Module checkpoints and deliverables through Gradescope. To create another way for students to communicate with each other we have created [this Piazza site](piazza.com/hmc/fall2021/ph50){:target="_blank"}. In Piazza you can ask questions to the class; we encourage you to use this forum to ask your classmates course-related questions and to answer each others questions. There are no grades associated with participation on Piazza, it is for your own benefit as a means to collaborate with each other. Office hours are posted on the "Office Hours" link on the side menu of Sakai. Please note that you must be logged into your g.hmc.edu account through a Google Chrome browser to access this information. **Students should feel welcome to attend any professor’s office hours.**

We will also be using Google apps including Docs, Sheets, and Colaboratory. There will be several templates assigned at various times throughout the course via Google Classroom. Google Classroom enables us to create copies of documents for every student. You will need to login to Google Classroom when prompted from the Module instructions, but you do not need to actively monitor Google Classroom for new assignments. Sakai is our primary point of contact with you, not Google Classroom.

# Lab Books and Data Sheets
## Lab Books
In this course we will not be using traditional lab books. Instead you will be assigned a Google Doc and Google Spreadsheet at the beginning of each module to keep your lab record. What we will stress in this course is not a particular structure or format for your lab book, but rather the usefulness of the record. **Please note that even though they are not graded, you are required to use the provided Google Doc and Google Spreadsheet to document your work and data collected in the lab. Deductions will apply if they are not used. In addition, the Google doc and Google spreadsheet issued to you through this course are the only material you will have access to during the practicum.**

What information will I need to replicate this experiment in 6 months or 6 years? Would a sketch or photo of the setup be helpful? How exactly did I take that particular data point? What did or did not work in my experimental procedure and what did I learn from it? What are my units? What does this variable mean? etc.

Your lab book will not receive a grade of its own, but the quality of your lab book will impact other graded portions of the lab. The hallmark of a good lab book is how useful it is to you and others at a later point in time. You will need the information from your lab book to complete your checkpoints, the end of module deliverables, and to be successful on the practicum. You will not have access to the lab manual during the practicum or to any notes outside of what you have recorded in the course-issued Google Docs and Google Spreadsheet. Detailed notes will be useful!

Some tips: 

+ Don’t rewrite history. 
    + If you realize you made a procedural mistake, resist the temptation to omit what was incorrect. Your lab notebook needs to be a complete record of what actually happened; that means the bad as well as the good.
    + Suggestions: use the comment feature, make a note in a different color (note the date if different), or highlight your mistake and refer yourself to further down the document where you’ve written up the correction. Find the method that works for you, but be sure your record is complete.
+ Include handwritten work.
    + There is rarely a lab that does not require a sketch or calculation. Do not use “scratch paper” without including it in your lab record. 
    + Google Docs has an app that allows you to insert a photo directly into your document from your phone. You can also use a camera to take a photo of your notes and upload them to your computer.
+ Include photos of your apparatus.
    + A picture truly is worth a thousand words when you are trying to remember how to set up your apparatus, or how to take a particular measurement.
    + It can be particularly powerful to upload a photo and then annotate it with a few well-placed arrows, words, etc.
+ Link to your various electronic files (Google Sheets, Colaboratory, etc) in the body of your document in the context of describing how you took that particular data. 
    + You can simply copy the URL of the item you wish to link to and paste it into your document.

## Data Sheets
We would like you to get in the habit of using formulae in Google Sheets to make your intermediate calculations. This helps avoid mistakes and it’s easier to fix any mistakes later. Although we aren’t grading your data sheet or lab notebook, we will look at them occasionally when grading your checkpoints and/or ask to see them in office hours. If we see formulae in your data sheet, we can more effectively help you debug any problems. Your data sheet, coupled with the history feature of Google sheets, also serves as a time record of your work in the lab. Recording data elsewhere and then later pasting it into Google sheets is not acceptable. However, it is acceptable to collect data in one lab partners notebook and then copy it to the partner's notebook. If so you should include a note to the effect "this data was originally collect in **Name of Lab Partner**'s laboratory notebook and is reproduced here".

# Collaboration
You will collect data with a partner in the lab. We expect student to perform the data analysis, miniquestions, checkpoints, and deliverables for themselves. If you would like to discuss with your lab partner or another classmate while doing analysis in parallel, we encourage that type of collaboration! It will likely not save you any time, but often working through material together gives a better learning experience. Just remember that each of you needs to do your own analysis.

# The Writing Center
The Writing Center provides a welcoming virtual space for writers to get feedback on their composition projects, whether written, spoken or visual pieces. Writing Center Consultants are prepared to assist students in any discipline with any stage of the writing process, from developing an idea to polishing a final draft. Even the most accomplished writers benefit from seeking feedback at the Writing Center. You may schedule an online appointment through their website, https://www.hmc.edu/learning-programs/writing-center/


# Accommodations
HMC is committed to providing an inclusive learning environment and support for all students. Given our current online learning environment, we recognize that the challenges facing students are different and student accommodation needs may change. Students with a disability (including mental health, chronic or temporary medical conditions) who may need some accommodation in order to fully participate in this class are encouraged to contact Educational Accessibility Services at ability@g.hmc.edu to request accommodations. Students from the other Claremont Colleges should contact their home college's disability resources officer.



# Wellness 
College can be stressful, and it’s important to support the physical and mental well-being of ourselves and others even as we work to learn challenging new material in courses like this one. That means getting some food, sleep, exercise and relaxation even during crunch time! If you find that you are in need of help or overwhelmed by this class, don’t hesitate to reach out to any of the course instructors or the Academic Deans at academicdeans@g.hmc.edu. We will work with you to develop a plan for success in this course. 


# Belonging
Everyone who is registered for this course belongs here and has valuable contributions to make to our class. Our diversity of backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints will enrich the classroom, and our mutual respect will allow us all the grace to make mistakes and learn from them.

# Title IX Notification
Harvey Mudd College is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, know that you are not alone.
