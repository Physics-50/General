## Plotting your data

In Physics 50 you will make use of a script provided here to plot your data:

**Please note that use of the provided plotting script for plotting your data is required; plots in Google sheets do not meet course expectations.**

To plot your data you first need to generate a .CSV file containing only your data and axis labels. You can do this from within your Google Sheets spreadsheet. 

Go to the tab in your spreadsheet that you will use to prepare your data for plotting. For module 3, week 3 this will be the third tab in your Module 1 data sheet: "Week 3: Data for Plotting".

1. You should rename the column headings in Row 1 to match your data. These will form the axis labels for your plot. You may surround algebraic variables and Greek letters with dollar signs; e.g., $\theta$ (Â°) or $L$ (cm) or $T^2$ (s$^2$) or $L_{\rm string}$ (cm), where \rm "removes" math mode and lets you include normally-formatted text within a mathematical formula.

2. If you followed the template for the "Week 2: Data Collection" tab of the spreadsheet then your entries will already be prefilled into the spreadsheet. Note the formatting that allows an entry to be copied from a previous sheet. Specifically: **='Week 2: Data Collection'!$B$23** will copy the entry from cell B23 into the new cell. Check to make sure that the entries are indeed the values you wish to export. (In week 3 of module 1 you will need to change the entries in the uncertainty column - make sure to pay attention to the note regarding this in the week 3 instructions)

3. You should now go to the "File" menu and select "Dowload". From within the download tab select "Comma Separated Values (.csv)" and save the file to your computer.

4. Now go to the [Physics 50 Fitting Page](https://physics.hmc.edu/fitter/). Under **Data** choose the .csv file you just saved. Under **Kind** select the type of fit you would like to perform. In module 1 this will be a "constant" fit, i.e. a horizontal line. Go to "kind" and select "constant". Click "Run the Fit".

5. The main plot should show the data points, error bars, fit function, fit information, and properly labeled axes.  The small upper plot shows "residuals," or the difference of each data point from the fit line or curve (along with the error bar of each data point).  A plot of residuals like this can be very useful when the variation of data away from the fit function is too small to see on the main plot.

6. You can save the resulting plot by right clicking on the graph.
