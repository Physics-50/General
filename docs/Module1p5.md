# Module 1.5

Module 1.5 is not a full module but a one week experiment with a checkpoint (no deliverable). There are also no mini-questions this week and most of the instruction and discussion will take place in lab.

The experiment: You will roll a ball down a ramp. The ramp should be set to 5$$\degree$$. You need to measure the horizontal distance the ball lands from the end of the ramp, including an estimate of the uncertainty in the measurement.

The tape provided on your bench can be used to visualize where the ball landed. Further instructions will be provided in lab. You should spend ~30min on an initial estimate. Please submit your estimate and uncertainty on the following form:

--------------------------

--------------------------
Once you have submitted your result please think about how you might obtain a more accurate estimate. Instructions for the rest of lab will be provided in class.

Following the class discussion and further investigations please submit your final estimate here:

# Checkpoint for module 1.5

Your checkpoint for this week (submitted on Gradescope) will include the following:

+ Your best estimate, with uncertainty, for the distance the ball landed from the ramp, based on your own results
+ Your best estimate of the distance and uncertainty from the class results
+ Answers to the following questions:
    - What were the primary sources of uncertainty that you found it essential to control to obtain accurate results in this experiment (explain)? Please limit your response to 2-3 sentences.
    - Do your results and those of the class as a whole appear reasonable? What basis are you using to reach this conclusion? Please limit your response to 1-2 sentences.
