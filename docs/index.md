## Module 1 Overview 

One of the main goals of this course is for you to "think like an experimental physicist." Instead of merely reinforcing specific concepts from other physics courses you've taken, we will focus on the experimental process. 

### Learning Objectives


<span class="strike">Reinforce concepts you learned in Ph24 and/or Ph51</span> ([why not?](https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.3816){:target="_blank"})

1. Create and execute a measurement plan for accuracy and precision, based on exploratory observations. 

2. Calculate a physical quantity based on experimental data and its uncertainty.

3. Record and communicate experimental results.


## Weekly Plan

To get started, we will begin with a simple experiment that meets the learning objectives above: measuring the speed of sound by exciting a sound wave of a known frequency and measuring its wavelength. Module 1 is two weeks long:  

1. [Week 1 - Exploration and First Careful Measurement](week1)
2. [Week 2 - Final Careful Measurements and Analysis](week2)
